FAQ
---

**What does LASSO do?**

    We are a high-end CAE company focusing on:
      - highly-complex structural mechanics
      - software engineering
      - machine learning and artificial intelligence
      - distribution and support of BETA CAE Systems products
      - manufacturing technology 

**Why sharing code as a company?** 

    Because the little things don't hurt us and CAE is already a harsh field.
    We will not get anywhere alone. Please take this as motivation to share 
    the small things and to help others make life easier.

**Can I use your software in my company**

    Yes, you can use it without any concerns. For further info 
    regarding redistribution please read the license file or contact
    us.
